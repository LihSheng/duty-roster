## Introduction

The People Management feature enhances the Duty Roster application by providing comprehensive functionality to manage team members who participate in the duty roster system. This feature will allow administrators to efficiently add, edit, view, and organize people in the system, including managing their contact information, availability, and preferences. The improved people management capabilities will support better duty assignments, communication, and overall roster management.

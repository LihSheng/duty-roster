# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Duty Roster application currently has several modal components that share similar structures and behaviors but are implemented independently. This leads to code duplication, inconsistent user experience, and increased maintenance overhead. The Reusable Components feature aims to create a set of standardized, reusable UI components that can be used across the application to improve code maintainability, ensure UI consistency, and enhance developer productivity. The components will leverage a modern styling approach to ensure a high-quality user experience and visual consistency.

## Requirements

3. WHEN the BaseModal is rendered THEN the system SHALL provide standard header, body, and footer sections.
4. WHEN the BaseModal is open THEN the system SHALL prevent interaction with the underlying page.
5. WHEN the close button is clicked THEN the system SHALL close the modal.
6. WHEN the escape key is pressed THEN the system SHALL close the modal.
7. WHEN the modal is closed THEN the system SHALL execute any provided onClose callback function.
8. WHEN the BaseModal is used THEN the system SHALL support customization of the modal size (small, medium, large).

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reusable form component library, so that I can create consistent form elements throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs to create form inputs THEN the system SHALL provide reusable form components (TextInput, Select, Checkbox, TextArea).
2. WHEN form components are used THEN the system SHALL provide consistent styling and behavior.

4. WHEN form components contain errors THEN the system SHALL display error messages in a consistent manner.
5. WHEN form components are disabled THEN the system SHALL visually indicate the disabled state.
6. WHEN form components are required THEN the system SHALL visually indicate the required state.
7. WHEN form components are used THEN the system SHALL support customization of size, variant, and appearance.
8. WHEN form components are styled THEN the system SHALL use a modern styling approach (such as Tailwind CSS) for enhanced UX.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reusable button components, so that I can create consistent button styles and behaviors throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs to create buttons THEN the system SHALL provide a reusable Button component.
2. WHEN the Button component is used THEN the system SHALL support different variants (primary, secondary, danger, success).
3. WHEN the Button component is used THEN the system SHALL support different sizes (small, medium, large).
4. WHEN the Button is disabled THEN the system SHALL visually indicate the disabled state and prevent interactions.
5. WHEN the Button is in loading state THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator and prevent further interactions.
6. WHEN the Button is clicked THEN the system SHALL execute the provided onClick callback function.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reusable loading indicator component, so that I can provide consistent loading states throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is loading THEN the system SHALL provide a reusable LoadingIndicator component.
2. WHEN the LoadingIndicator component is used THEN the system SHALL support different sizes (small, medium, large).
3. WHEN the LoadingIndicator is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a visually consistent loading animation.
4. WHEN the LoadingIndicator is used with text THEN the system SHALL display the loading text alongside the animation.
5. WHEN the LoadingIndicator is used in a container THEN the system SHALL support centering within the container.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to refactor existing components to use the new reusable components, so that the application has a consistent look and feel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the reusable components are implemented THEN the system SHALL refactor ConfirmationModal to use the BaseModal component.
2. WHEN the reusable components are implemented THEN the system SHALL refactor AddDutyModal to use the BaseModal and form components.
3. WHEN the reusable components are implemented THEN the system SHALL refactor EditAssigneeModal to use the BaseModal and form components.
4. WHEN existing components are refactored THEN the system SHALL maintain all current functionality.
5. WHEN existing components are refactored THEN the system SHALL improve the visual consistency across the application.

## Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement a modern styling approach, so that the application has a consistent, visually appealing, and responsive design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing reusable components THEN the system SHALL integrate a modern CSS utility framework like Tailwind CSS.

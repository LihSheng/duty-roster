# Design Document: Coding Standards Implementation

## Overview

This design document outlines the approach for implementing consistent coding standards across the project. The solution will leverage industry-standard tools and practices to enforce code quality and consistency while minimizing developer friction. The implementation will cover JavaScript/Node.js code, React components, CSS/Tailwind styling, and overall project structure.

## Architecture

The coding standards implementation will consist of several interconnected components:

1. **Linting Configuration** - Core rules and settings for static code analysis
2. **Formatting Tools** - Automated code formatting capabilities
3. **Git Hooks** - Pre-commit validation to catch issues early
4. **Documentation** - Guidelines and examples for developers
5. **IDE Integration** - Editor-specific configurations for real-time feedback
6. **Project Structure Standards** - Directory organization and file naming conventions
7. **Dependency Management** - Module boundaries and import/export patterns

These components will work together to create a cohesive system that enforces standards throughout the development lifecycle.

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Linting Configuration

#### ESLint Configuration

- Base configuration extending from established standards (Airbnb, Standard, etc.)

- Cross-editor consistency

### 3. Git Hooks

#### Husky Configuration

- Staged files validation

#### lint-staged Configuration

- File type specific linting commands
- Performance optimizations for large codebases

### 4. Documentation

#### Standards Documentation

### 5. IDE Integration

#### VS Code Configuration

- Recommended extensions
- Workspace settings
- Snippets for common patterns

#### Other IDEs

- Configuration files for other popular editors
- Consistency across different development environments

### 6. Project Structure Standards

#### Directory Organization

- Standardized folder structure for frontend and backend code
- Feature-based organization patterns
- Separation of concerns (components, services, utilities, etc.)
- Guidelines for shared code and assets

#### File Naming Conventions

- Consistent naming patterns for different file types
- Case conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, kebab-case)
- File extension usage
- Special file naming (index.js, constants.js, etc.)

#### Component Structure

- Standard organization for React components
- Patterns for container vs. presentational components
- Guidelines for component co-location of styles, tests, and related files

### 7. Dependency Management

#### Import/Export Patterns

- Standards for module exports (named vs. default)
- Import organization and grouping
- Path aliasing for cleaner imports
- Barrel file usage (index.js exports)

#### Dependency Boundaries

- Rules to prevent circular dependencies
- Module encapsulation guidelines
- Interface definitions between modules
- Guidelines for third-party dependency evaluation and integration

```

### Rule Configuration Schema

ESLint, Prettier, and Stylelint configurations will follow their respective schema formats. The project will use JavaScript-based configuration files (rather than JSON or YAML) to allow for comments and dynamic configuration.

## Error Handling

### Linting Errors

- Clear error messages with file and line references
- Categorization of errors (critical vs. stylistic)
- Autofix capabilities for supported rules
- Documentation links for complex issues

### CI/CD Integration

- Fail builds on critical errors
- Warning reports for non-critical issues
- Trend analysis for code quality metrics

## Testing Strategy

### Configuration Testing

- Validate configuration files against schemas
- Test for conflicts between tools (e.g., ESLint vs. Prettier)
- Ensure all file types are covered by appropriate tools

### Integration Testing

- Test git hooks functionality
- Verify CI/CD pipeline integration
- Test IDE integration with sample files

### User Acceptance Testing

- Developer feedback collection
- Measure impact on development workflow
- Adjust rules based on practical usage

## Implementation Considerations

### Phased Rollout

1. **Initial Setup** - Basic configuration with essential rules
2. **Existing Codebase Adaptation** - Bulk fixing or selective enforcement
3. **Full Enforcement** - Complete ruleset with CI/CD integration

### Performance Optimization

- Configure tools to run only on changed files
- Use caching mechanisms for linting results
- Parallelize linting processes where possible

### Maintenance Plan

- Regular updates to align with evolving best practices
- Periodic review of custom rules
- Feedback mechanism for developers to suggest changes

## Tool Selection

Based on the project's current stack (Node.js, React, Tailwind CSS), the following tools are recommended:

1. **ESLint** - For JavaScript/JSX linting
2. **Prettier** - For code formatting
3. **Stylelint** - For CSS/SCSS linting
4. **Husky** - For Git hooks
5. **lint-staged** - For optimized pre-commit checks
6. **EditorConfig** - For basic editor settings

These tools represent industry standards and have strong community support, extensive documentation, and regular updates.

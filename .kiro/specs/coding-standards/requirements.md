# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing coding standards across the project. Coding standards ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability of code across the entire codebase. They help reduce bugs, improve collaboration between team members, and make onboarding new developers easier.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent coding standards across the project, so that code is readable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer writes JavaScript code THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent formatting rules.
2. WHEN a developer writes CSS/Tailwind code THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent styling conventions.
3. WHEN a developer creates new components THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent naming conventions.
4. WHEN a developer commits code THEN the system SHALL automatically check for coding standard violations.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated tools to enforce coding standards, so that manual code reviews can focus on logic and architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL run linting tools to check for style violations.
2. WHEN style violations are detected THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with guidance on how to fix them.
3. WHEN possible THEN the system SHALL automatically fix simple style violations.
4. WHEN configuring linting rules THEN the system SHALL allow for project-specific customizations.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a new developer, I want clear documentation on coding standards, so that I can quickly adapt to the project's conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new developer joins the project THEN the system SHALL provide documentation on coding standards.
2. WHEN coding standards are updated THEN the system SHALL update the documentation accordingly.
3. WHEN a developer has questions about specific standards THEN the system SHALL provide examples of correct implementation.
4. WHEN a developer needs to understand the reasoning behind a standard THEN the system SHALL provide explanations for key decisions.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to ensure consistent code structure across components, so that the codebase remains organized as it grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new components THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent file structure.
2. WHEN organizing imports THEN the system SHALL enforce a consistent order and grouping.
3. WHEN defining component props THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent typing and documentation.
4. WHEN implementing component lifecycle methods THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent ordering and implementation patterns.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want IDE integration for coding standards, so that I can see and fix issues while coding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing code in supported IDEs THEN the system SHALL highlight coding standard violations in real-time.
2. WHEN saving files in supported IDEs THEN the system SHALL offer to automatically fix simple violations.
3. WHEN configuring the IDE THEN the system SHALL provide easy setup instructions for coding standard tools.
4. WHEN coding standards are updated THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism to update IDE configurations.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project architect, I want standardized project structure and organization, so that the codebase remains scalable and navigable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new modules or features THEN the system SHALL enforce a consistent directory structure.
2. WHEN adding new files THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent file naming conventions across the project.
3. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidelines for separating concerns (e.g., components, services, utilities).
4. WHEN implementing new features THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent patterns for feature organization.

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear guidelines for module boundaries and dependencies, so that I can maintain a clean architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing modules THEN the system SHALL enforce rules to prevent circular dependencies.
2. WHEN defining module interfaces THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent patterns for exports and imports.
3. WHEN adding new dependencies THEN the system SHALL provide guidelines for evaluating and documenting them.
4. WHEN structuring the application THEN the system SHALL enforce clear separation between frontend, backend, and shared code.

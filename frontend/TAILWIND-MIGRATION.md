# Tailwind CSS Migration

This document outlines the migration from manual CSS to Tailwind CSS in the Duty Roster application.

## Changes Made

1. Removed all manual CSS files:
   - `frontend/src/fixes.css`
   - `frontend/src/App.css`
   - `frontend/src/components/Calendar.css`
   - `frontend/src/components/calendar-fix.css`
   - `frontend/src/components/duties/AddDutyModal.css`
   - `frontend/src/components/common/modal/modal-fix.css`

2. Created/Updated Tailwind CSS files:
   - `frontend/src/tailwind.css` - Base Tailwind imports and core component styles
   - `frontend/src/tailwind-components.css` - Application-specific component styles

3. Updated imports in the following files:
   - `frontend/src/App.js`
   - `frontend/src/components/duties/AddDutyModal.js`
   - `frontend/src/components/common/modal/BaseModal.js`

## Tailwind Component Classes

The migration preserves all the styling from the original CSS files but uses Tailwind's utility classes. The component classes are defined in `tailwind-components.css` using Tailwind's `@layer components` directive.

Key components that were migrated:

- Calendar layout and styling
- Button variants
- Modal components
- Duty items and actions
- Form elements
- Utility classes

## Benefits of the Migration

1. **Consistency**: All styling now uses the same design system and color palette
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and update styles
3. **Performance**: Reduced CSS bundle size
4. **Responsive Design**: Better responsive behavior using Tailwind's responsive utilities
5. **Dark Mode Support**: Improved dark mode support with Tailwind's dark mode utilities

## Next Steps

1. Continue to refine component styles as needed
2. Consider using Tailwind's JIT (Just-In-Time) mode for even better performance
3. Review and update any components that might need style adjustments
